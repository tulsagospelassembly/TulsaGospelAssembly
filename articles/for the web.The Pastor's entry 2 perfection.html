<P class="p0 ft0">The Pastor’s Study:</P>
<P class="p1 ft0">Entry Number 2 on the subject of biblical perfection and overcoming.</P>
<P class="p2 ft1">Biblical Perfection</P>
<P class="p3 ft1">A helpful and necessary understanding in the matter of <SPAN class="ft2">“let us go on unto perfection.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p3 ft3">King James Version throughout with emphasis added. Repetition is purposeful.</P>
<P class="p4 ft1">Introduction</P>
<P class="p5 ft4">The subject of perfection offends some and tends to be ignored, marginalized, or even rejected. The intent of this article will be to gain agreement that the overcoming process is biblical, reasonable, possible, and to be embraced. Overcoming and perfection is a God ordained Spiritual operation and a correct understanding of the subject produces neither exaltation or discouragement.</P>
<P class="p6 ft4">It is imperative that we carry forward the fact that this whole matter is accomplished as we abide in the “estate” of “in Christ.” This understanding, as mentioned in the introductory article, is foundational. The estate of being in Christ equates to being in his Body which is his Church.</P>
<P class="p7 ft1">The Word; “Perfect”</P>
<P class="p5 ft8"><SPAN class="ft5">Jesus said </SPAN>“Be ye therefore <SPAN class="ft6">perfect</SPAN>, even as your Father which is in heaven is <SPAN class="ft6">perfect</SPAN>.” <SPAN class="ft5">St. Matthew 5:48. The word </SPAN>“<SPAN class="ft6">perfect</SPAN>” <SPAN class="ft5">expresses the concept of being “</SPAN><SPAN class="ft7">complete</SPAN><SPAN class="ft5">,” even “</SPAN><SPAN class="ft7">finished</SPAN><SPAN class="ft5">.” The same Greek word is used in James 1:4</SPAN>, “But let patience have her <SPAN class="ft6">perfect</SPAN> work, that ye may be <SPAN class="ft6">perfect</SPAN> and <SPAN class="ft6">entire</SPAN>, <SPAN class="ft6">wanting nothing</SPAN>.” <SPAN class="ft5">Also</SPAN>, <SPAN class="ft5">Ephesians 4:13, </SPAN>“Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a <SPAN class="ft6">perfect</SPAN> man, unto the measure of the stature of the <SPAN class="ft6">fullness of Christ:</SPAN>”</P>
<P class="p8 ft5">Perfection is <SPAN class="ft7">mistakenly</SPAN> viewed as doing everything right, having total maturity and never missing the mark. This perception of perfection would lead a person toward <SPAN class="ft7">will worship</SPAN> and a very human <SPAN class="ft7">works</SPAN> mentality. “Perfection” is often approached from the standpoint of <SPAN class="ft7">our</SPAN> doings, <SPAN class="ft7">our</SPAN> definitions and <SPAN class="ft7">our</SPAN> perceptions. The tragedy of this emphasis is that we might settle for a <NOBR>pride-driven</NOBR> corral, or trap, where the natural mind rides around in circles. Then the confession comes forth: It is impossible! Consequently, much of Christendom marginalizes or outright rejects the Biblical message of perfection as unattainable. That is reasonably true, but Jesus stated a principle; <SPAN class="ft8">“…With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.” </SPAN>St. Matthew 19:26.</P>
<P class="p9 ft10">Perfection pertains to the dispositional part, where His Spirit connects and works in our spirit. It is a spiritual work and the determinations, or doing of the thing, is God working “in us,” and us “in Him.” Rest assured; His Glory, not ours, His righteousness, not ours<SPAN class="ft9">. “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.” </SPAN>Romans 8:14.</P>

<DIV id="id2_1">
<P class="p11 ft1">Perfection; The Subject</P>
<P class="p12 ft5">This Biblical imperative is typically treated from the standpoint of an individual <SPAN class="ft7">striving</SPAN> for the sinless life, purity of mind and body, and maturity. Humbly stated: We must understand that on a platform of truth, <SPAN class="ft7">our striving</SPAN> cannot entertain contest or emulation, especially relating to our fellow believers. Referring expressly to that point: Philippians 1:27 states, <SPAN class="ft8">“…stand fast in one spirit, with one mind, </SPAN><SPAN class="ft6">striving together</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8"> for the faith of the gospel;” </SPAN>The meaning of <SPAN class="ft8">“strive” </SPAN>in the native idiom (Greek), as used in this scripture, is to endeavor and struggle, even <SPAN class="ft7">agonize together</SPAN>. Correctly defined, we believe that to strive for perfection is good and correct.</P>
<P class="p13 ft5">Having this charity evident among us, we progress with carefulness; not stopping our progress in God with “reconciliation,” but going forward we spiritually embrace “his life” example; our pathway of charity. <SPAN class="ft8">“For if, when we were enemies, we were </SPAN><SPAN class="ft6">reconciled</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8"> to God by the death of his Son, </SPAN><SPAN class="ft6">much more</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">, being reconciled, we shall be saved by </SPAN><SPAN class="ft6">his life</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">.” </SPAN>Romans 5:10. To be reconciled and converted is an estate or place. It is the place in God where the ongoing work of <NOBR>at-one-ment</NOBR> and perfection continues. Conversion and reconciliation is essentially our entrance into Christ; the very estate or habitation where we grow “in Christ.” It is another expression for experiencing a growth of the <NOBR>inner-man.</NOBR> That would be; <SPAN class="ft8">“Christ in you, the hope of glory.” </SPAN>Colossians 2:27.</P>
<P class="p9 ft4">A sinless life lies in a total and complete embrace of the Lord’s exemplary life. That is an operation of Holy Ghost power in the inner man; taking on his nature. <SPAN class="ft13">“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">partakers of the divine nature</SPAN><SPAN class="ft13">, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.” </SPAN>II Peter 1:4.</P>
<P class="p14 ft4">The course of overcoming deals with all sin; weights, conduct, manners, deportment, demeanor, and conversation. In the overview; overcoming is realizing spiritual dominion and the defeat of our otherwise <SPAN class="ft10">pride driven</SPAN> life.</P>
<P class="p15 ft13"><SPAN class="ft4">The works of the flesh. </SPAN>“…Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envying, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like…” <SPAN class="ft4">Galatians </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft4">5:19-21.</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft4"> All are traits of the carnal mind, will, and emotions of fallen man; traits of a fleshly, pride driven nature.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p16 ft1">Perfection; Thy Will be Done</P>
<P class="p13 ft5">Perfecting (perfection) our embrace of Jesus leaves no place for a <NOBR>pride-driven,</NOBR> willful route to greatness. <SPAN class="ft7">Perish the thought that a total embrace of Jesus would accommodate even the desire for a status of infallibility</SPAN>. A great danger lies with our persistence in qualifying and expressing the matter of perfection as though it resides in our court. We risk discounting the <SPAN class="ft8">“power” </SPAN>mentioned in Acts 1:8. <SPAN class="ft8">“…ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.”</SPAN></P>

<DIV id="id3_1">
<P class="p18 ft5">Our submitted will is good and the application of our will is required. However, the Grace- given Spiritual Power is where the perfecting is wrought in the life of a Holy Ghost person. <SPAN class="ft8">“And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:” </SPAN>Colossians 2:10. This is the “best.” The “good,” our submitted will, would be counterproductive to the “best” if it becomes a stopping point. The best is dispensed from heaven. Quoting again; Jesus said <SPAN class="ft8">“ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you…” </SPAN>Acts 1:8. We must reckon our willful striving as being subordinate to the spiritual operation of the Holy Ghost. That operation is accomplished in the spiritual arena of our quickened conscience, communion, and intuition. More on that later.</P>
<P class="p19 ft5">Romans Chapter 7 gives an account of the limited result of a willful obedience to the Law; yielding no change of disposition (our heart or spirit) and failing to accomplish God’s perfect will. Reading into chapter 8, we understand that being <SPAN class="ft8">“in Christ Jesus,” </SPAN>verse 1, embraces the operation of the Spirit. Holy Ghost power gains us freedom and dominion over “<SPAN class="ft8">the law of sin and death.” </SPAN>Romans 8:2. <SPAN class="ft7">The prospect of </SPAN><SPAN class="ft6">“go on unto perfection,” </SPAN><SPAN class="ft7">Hebrews 6:1, is not of the Law, it is of Grace; that is, being </SPAN><SPAN class="ft6">“in Christ Jesus</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft5">The accomplishing of God’s perfect will in the lives of his Saints, and the Church collectively, is not <NOBR>as-per-our-will</NOBR> but <NOBR>as-per-His-Will.</NOBR> Outside the “In Christ,” Holy Ghost estate, even a submitted will, <SPAN class="ft8">“the law of the mind,” </SPAN>Romans 7:23, is no match for the <SPAN class="ft8">“law of sin and death.” </SPAN>The actual doing of God’s will is a spiritual matter; so that, it must be facilitated and made possible thru the operation of the Holy Ghost; the Spirit of God reunited with the spirit in man. This allows for the Holy Ghost to effectually work in the life of a Saint of God. To be born again of the Spirit, to become a Child of God, in Christ, a New Creature; that is the Grace of God. It is the “estate” of His imputing the righteousness of Christ in us and not imputing our sins. It is God’s will that His Grace result in the perfecting of the Saints. To deny the message of overcoming and perfection is to deny God’s will and the divine operation of Grace.</P>
<P class="p13 ft5">Knowing these things, we are sure that <SPAN class="ft7">our striving</SPAN> must not be a matter of willful determinations; rather according as <SPAN class="ft7">our will is submitted to God’s Holy Spirit Power</SPAN>. That power ministers to us as being <NOBR>born-again</NOBR> and living our lives under the blood of Christ and “in Christ.” The comparable “estate” would be “in the world but not of the world.” An awareness, confession, and submission of <NOBR>our-will</NOBR> to <NOBR>God’s-will</NOBR> helps us better grasp and embrace the scriptural path of overcoming and perfection. <SPAN class="ft7">Being in spiritual order moves us toward a “complete” embrace of Christ’ example. To be completely “in Christ” is tantamount to being completed/perfected. The new man has replaced the old man.</SPAN></P>
