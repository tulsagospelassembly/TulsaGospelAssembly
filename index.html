                    Tulsa Gospel Assembly, presently located at 8515 N. Whirlpool Dr., Sperry, Oklahoma, is a body of
                    believers existing for the purpose of service the will of the Almighty God and of teaching and
                    promoting and exemplifying the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is our Faith and Conviction that the Judaic-Christian Bible is the inspired Word of God. The King 
                    James translation is the preferred English text to which we adhere.<br>
                    <br>
                    We believe the Bible avows and portrays Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to be the only door and path
                    of reconciliation to God and that he is the Father's provision for man's redemption and salvation.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Church believes the Bible is to be taken literally in the belief and embrace of miracles and
                    spiritual gifts and leadershio of the Holy Ghost and the signiture of the Spirit is to speak in 
                    tongues as evidence of Pentecost.<br>
                    <br>
                    We adhere to the Biblically understood statements regarding morality, life style, and conduct; and
                    this adherence wil preempt any civil or societal demand that in invasive, or acts to hurt the
                    conscience of the Church.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Church will declare the Gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ without agreement of concession to 
                    discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age or national origin.<br>
                    <br>
                    Written of declared positions of doctrine are subject to refinement and clarification and change when
                    revelation of greater understanding prevails.

                <p class="content-title">STATEMENT OF THE CHURCH OPERATION</p>
                <p class="statement-of-the-church-operation-content">
                    The Gospel Assembly Irrevocable Charitable Trust of April 11, 1954 as amended, is the legal vessel of
                    ownership and reflects its manner of business regarding material assets, and said Trust is servant to
                    all that appertains to the spiritual operation and wellbeing of the Church.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Church is to function as autonomous in its ownership and operation and in the oversight of its
                    membership and its ministry; all the while giving due consideration of outside council and meaningful
                    interdependency.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Ministers, Elders, and Trustees, working together and toward Biblical correctness is the ordained
                    management of the Church and their willingness toward transparency and accountability is required.<br>
                    <br>
                    Church policy and procedure must incline to protect the Church and its Membership in its duties and
                    responsibilites in matters of morality or legal offence.<br>
                    <br>
                    Written or declared positions of "operations" as well as doctrine are subject to refinement and 
                    clarification and change when revelation or greater understanding prevails.<br>
                    <br>
                    Regarding "the Common Good," it is present church policy that 20%, more or less, of the gross income
                    of the Church will be distributed outside the local operation.<br>
                    <br>
                    The amount will include religious tax exempt entities and also non-religious tax exempt entities. The
                    religious entities woudl necessarily include those familiar to this local church, and visiting
                    ministries; the latter typically receiving the greater amount.<br>
                    <br>
                    Trustees, Elders, Deacons, and other Church Officers serve on a voluntary basis. The Pastor presently,
                    and for the past 8 years, ministers on a voluntary basis. This is subject to change if the need should
                    occur.
