                <p>
                    Pastor Thomas F. Igler was born May 1941, in Miami, Florida. His pre-teen years were spent in the 
                    Miami, Hialeah area. His parents were Catholic and Episcopalian so that he was baptized Catholic as
                    an infant. At age 3 years, his parents' marriage of 12 years ended in a divorce. His stepfather had 
                    a Baptist background so at about age 5 he began attending the Edison Center Baptist Church. There, 
                    at a young age, is where he experienced his first spiritual touch from the Lord. About the time his
                    stepfather obtained his Journeyman status, they decided to move to Houston, Texas. That plan ended 
                    in Mineola, Texas, his home town, after hearing of the polio outbreak in the Bayou City. The best
                    recollection is summer, 1946.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sometime in 1948 his mother came in contact with the "body of Christ" group. He, his mother, and 
                    older brother began to attend their small group of Pentecostal worshipers in Hialeah; very poor, 
                    sawdust floor, and unacceptable to the stepfather. Going forward; a divorce ensued and a one year 
                    move to Ocala, Florida, and then back to Hialeah. In October 1951, there was the move to Louisville, 
                    Kentucky. It was a dreadful experience with asthma and fear; the winter of 51-52. Early-on the older 
                    brother moved back to Miami. They attended the Gospel Chapel Church in Louisville. Brother Will 
                    Sowders was ill and not able to be in the services. Brother James Sowders was the Minister. Early 
                    Spring, they moved back to Miami and were more or less unchurched for about a year. Most critical 
                    to this brief narrative is the fact that they were thoroughly indoctrinated with the Body of Christ 
                    doctrine and teachings and lifestyle.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mid 1953 mother and son moved to Tampa, Florida to attend the Gospel Tabernacle Church with Brother 
                    Aebersold as Pastor. Net: further teaching and grounding in biblical precepts and traditions. 
                    Thereafter, 6 years of area schools, National Honor Society, and graduation from Hillsborough High 
                    School with honors. A National Defense Loan allowed for 3 semesters and 2 summer school sessions at 
                    the University of Florida: In the end, nothing he could take to the bank but a sincere thanks for a 
                    good liberal arts and sciences education. The more profitable knowledge: To be painfully aware of 
                    what you do not know.<br>
                    <br>
                    In early 1962, with a Ford Foundation grant on the table, he moved to Houston, Texas. By March of 
                    that year he was fully integrated into the Gospel Assembly Church, Brother Clyde Patton being Pastor. 
                    September 15th of that same year he married Barbara Singletary, his present wife of 58 years. There 
                    they labored faithfully 21 years, and were trained and ordained to the ministry. His employment was 18 
                    years with Shell Oil Co. E & P.<br>
                    <br>
                    Wife, Barbara was born in Baytown, Texas and grew up in the Houston area. In 1955 she was saved and
                    filled with the Holy Spirit. From childhood she was a working member of the Houston Gospel Chapel in
                    Port Houston. She attended and graduated from Austin High School.<br>
                    <br>
                    Together they pastored for 2 years in Cut-N-Shoot, Texas. It was a priceless and memorable experience. God's 
                    love and God's blessings were in that place.<br>
                    <br>
                    37 years ago, January 1983, Pastor Tom was delegated to oversee the Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma. With 
                    wife and younger son Bradley they made the move to Tulsa. Their older son Rodney did not make the 
                    move and has since retired and resides with his family in the Houston area. Bradley, nearing 
                    retirement, with family, now resides in the Boulder, Colorado area.<br>
                    <br>
                    Pastor's health is failing after multiple surgeries, radiation, and chemo. He remains on 2 cancer 
                    maintenance protocols. While retired and being somewhat limited, he continues, on a volunteer basis, 
                    as Pastor and Teacher.
